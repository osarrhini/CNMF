# Enhanced Extraction of Blood and Tissue Time-activity Curves in Cardiac Mouse FDG PET Imaging by Means of Constrained Nonnegative Matrix Factorization
This repository contains the source code for extracting left ventricle blood pool and myocardial time-activity curves from cardiac FDG PET images of mice. The method is based on the Constrained Nonnegative Matrix Factorization algorithm (CNMF).

# Usage
Please refer to the comments in the code for helpful information on how to use this package and to know which type of data CNMF is expecting.
